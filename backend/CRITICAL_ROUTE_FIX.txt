CRITICAL ROUTE REGISTRATION FIX - v1.0.36
==========================================

PROBLEM: Render using cached build - routes not registering

SOLUTION: Multiple build triggers to force rebuild

Expected logs after rebuild:
- ðŸš€ SERVER STARTING - All imports loaded successfully!
- ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL BUILD v1.0.35 - [timestamp]
- ðŸ“¦ Building for Render deployment - Route registration fix!
- ðŸš€ CRITICAL BUILD 999 - [timestamp]
- ðŸ”¥ ROUTE REGISTRATION FIX - ALL ENDPOINTS MUST WORK
- ðŸ“¦ Version: 1.0.35 - RENDER MUST REBUILD NOW!
- ðŸ”¥ Registering ALL routes...
- âœ… NEW routes registered: /api/promotions, /api/cyber, /api/tasks, /api/messages, /api/notifications

If these DON'T appear after deploy, Render needs manual cache clear!
